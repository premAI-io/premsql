schema and user query. Your job is to output the list of table names which will
be included in the user's SQL query. 

Here are some examples:

NOTE: Only read the user question and dataframe above and give the analysis and reasoning
in JSON format only. Nothing else. Respond only with valid JSON.

Your JSON keys should be only: `analysis` and `analysis_reasoning`

### Instruction: Respond only with valid JSON. No introduction or summary needed. You are a senior data analyst. You know how to plot data when asked some analysis question. Do not add ``` at start / end of the output.

You will be given a user question, a list of dataframe column names, and you will output a JSON with
the following structure:

{{
    "x": # output the column name which should be on x-axis,
    "y": # output the column name which should be on y-axis,
    "plot_type": # The type of plot

You can choose from these plot types:

- area: if you think you need to plot an area chart,
- bar: if you think you need to plot a bar chart,
- scatter: if you think you need to plot a scatter plot,
- histogram: if you think you need to plot a histogram,
- line: if you think you need to plot a line chart,
### Examples:

Example 1:
User Question: "Show the relationship between sales and revenue."

Dataframe columns: ["product_name", "sales", "revenue"]

Output:
{{
    "x": "sales",
    "y": "revenue",
    "plot_type": "scatter"

Example 2:
User Question: "Show the distribution of product sales."

Dataframe columns: ["product_name", "sales"]

Output:

Like the above example, here is your dataframe columns: {columns}

NOTE: From user's question you need to find the column of the table that makes
sense. Do not add any column name which is not present in {columns}. If there is nothing
to add just put None

BASELINE_FOLLOWUP_WORKER_PROMPT = """
### Instruction: Respond only with valid JSON. No introduction or summary needed.
You will act like a simple conversation agent who knows to manage it's assistant who either plots or
write SQL query. If your assistant fails in quering the DB or plotting a graph then your job is to 
suggest user an alternative question or decision that will help your assistant to be successful in either query / plot / analysis next time.
Do not add ``` at start / end of the output.

You will be recieving the following input:
1. DB Schema: The schema of the database 
2. Decision: The decision that your assistant took. Decision could be either 'query' or 'plot' or 'analyse'
3. Query: The question that user asked.
4. Dataframe: (Optinal can be null) the dataframe that was being output or given as input
5. Analysis: Some text analysis from the model
6. Error from assistant: The error that your assistant made. 

Your job is to output a JSON with the following structure:

{{
    "alternate_decision": # can be either query / plot,
    "suggestion": # the alternate suggestive question 
}}

Here is an example:
Example 1:
DB Schema: 
CREATE TABLE sales (
    product_id INT,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    sale_date DATE,
    revenue FLOAT
);

Decision: "query"
Query: "What is the average revenue for products sold after 2023?"
Dataframe: null
Analysis: null
Error from assistant: "Query failed due to incorrect date format."

Output:
{{
    "alternate_decision": "query",
    "suggestion": "Could you find the average revenue for products sold in 2024 onwards?"
}}
Example 2:
DB Schema:
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT,
    employee_name VARCHAR(100),
    department VARCHAR(100),
    salary FLOAT
);

Decision: "plot"
Query: "Show a line chart of the salary distribution by department."
Dataframe: null
Analysis: null
Error from assistant: "Data insufficient to generate the plot."

Output:
{{
    "alternate_decision": "plot",
    "suggestion": "Could you plot a bar chart showing total salary by department instead?"
}}

Example 1:
DB Schema:
CREATE TABLE sales (
    product_id INT,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    sale_date DATE,
    revenue FLOAT
);

Decision: "plot"
Query: "Plot the monthly revenue trend for 2024."
Dataframe: null
Analysis: null
Error from assistant: "Insufficient data to plot the monthly trend."

Output:
{{
    "alternate_decision": "query",
    "suggestion": "Can you query the total monthly revenue for 2024 so we can plot the trend afterward?"
}}

Example:
DB Schema:
CREATE TABLE sales (

    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    sale_date DATE,
    revenue FLOAT

Decision: "analyse"
Query: "Why xyz product name is doing unwell"
